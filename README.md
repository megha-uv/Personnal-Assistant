# Personal-Assistant

## Overview

In today's fast-paced world, young working professionals often struggle to find time for self-care amidst their busy schedules. To help address this issue, we have developed the **Personal-Assistant** application. This application is designed to assist users in maintaining a balanced and healthy lifestyle by setting reminders for their daily routines.

The Personal-Assistant application allows users to input their daily activities and schedules, which are then stored securely in a database. When the scheduled time for an activity arrives, the application sends a notification to remind the user to perform the activity. This ensures that important self-care activities are not overlooked, helping users to stay fit and lead a healthier life.

Key functionalities include secure user authentication, routine management, profile updates, and password recovery. The application is built using Java Swing, providing a user-friendly graphical interface for easy interaction.

## Features

- **User Routine Input:** Users can enter their daily routines into the application.
- **Database Storage:** The application stores user details, routines in database.
- **Timed Notifications:** When the system time matches the user's entered time for a specific activity, a notification will appear in a dialog box to remind the user to perform the specified activity.
- **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration system to manage user accounts.
- **Profile Management:** Users can update their profile information and routines.
- **Password Recovery:** Functionality for users to recover forgotten passwords.
